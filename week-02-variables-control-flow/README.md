# Week 2: Variables and Control Flow

## 📚 Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Implement complex conditional statements (nested if-else, switch-case)
- Use logical operators (&&, ||, !) effectively
- Create menu-driven systems with multiple options
- Implement input validation and error handling
- Solve real-world problems using control flow

## 🎓 Topics Covered
1. **Conditional Statements**: Nested if-else, else-if ladders
2. **Switch-Case**: Alternative to multiple if-else statements
3. **Logical Operators**: AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!)
4. **Loop Control**: break, continue in loops
5. **Range Checking**: Validating input within specific ranges
6. **Boolean Logic**: Making decisions based on multiple conditions

## 📁 Files in This Week

### Examples
These demonstrate core Week 2 concepts:
- `conditional_statements.cpp` - If, else if, else, nested if
- `switch_case.cpp` - Switch statements with cases and default
- `loop_control.cpp` - break, continue, nested loops
- `logical_operators.cpp` - &&, ||, ! operators with practical examples
- `multiplication_table.cpp` - For loops with formatted output

### Exercises
Practice problems based on your submitted code:
1. **divisible_by_7.cpp** - Mathematical algorithm to check divisibility by 7
2. **triangle_type.cpp** - Classifies triangles (equilateral, isosceles, scalene)
3. **fat_calculator.cpp** - Calculates fat percentage with health check
4. **university_admission.cpp** - Determines admission based on marks (nested if)
5. **sleep_in.cpp** - Boolean logic for sleep schedule
6. **coffee_machine.cpp** - Calculates preparation times based on multiple factors
7. **richter_scale.cpp** - Earthquake classification based on magnitude
8. **food_ordering.cpp** - Restaurant ordering system with bill calculation

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run
```bash
# Navigate to exercises folder
cd week-02-variables-control-flow/exercises

# Compile any program
g++ triangle_type.cpp -o triangle

# Run the program
./triangle      # Linux/Mac
triangle.exe    # Windows
