# Week 1: Introduction to C++ Programming

## 📚 Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Write, compile, and run simple C++ programs
- Use basic input/output operations (cin, cout)
- Declare and use variables of basic data types
- Implement basic control structures (if, while, for, do-while)
- Perform arithmetic and bitwise operations

## 🎓 Topics Covered
1. **Program Structure**: main() function, includes, namespaces
2. **Input/Output**: cout, cin, endl, stream operators
3. **Variables**: int, double, char, bool types
4. **Operators**: Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %), assignment (=), bitwise (>>)
5. **Control Structures**: if statements, while loops, for loops, do-while loops

## 📁 Files in This Week

### Examples
These are example programs demonstrating basic concepts:
- `hello_world.cpp` - Basic program structure
- `basic_io.cpp` - Input/output operations
- `variables_types.cpp` - Data types and variables
- `arithmetic_operations.cpp` - Math operations
- `control_structures.cpp` - If-else and loops

### Exercises
Practice problems based on your submitted code:
1. **basic_input_output.cpp** - Takes two numbers, performs bitwise right shift on first, squares second, loops until equal
2. **variable_operations.cpp** - While loops with break conditions, nested loops, counter variables
3. **ticket_purchase.cpp** - Menu-driven ticket system with seat availability and discount calculation
4. **number_squares.cpp** - Calculates squares, categorizes numbers (positive, negative, in range)
5. **multiplication_quiz.cpp** - Interactive quiz with random multiplication questions
6. **average_calculator.cpp** - Calculates averages for 3 courses with 4 students each
7. **linear_equation_solver.cpp** - Finds integer solutions to 3a + 7b - 5c = 10

## 🔧 How to Compile and Run
```bash
# Navigate to exercises folder
cd week-01-introduction/exercises

# Compile any program
g++ basic_input_output.cpp -o program

# Run the program
./program      # Linux/Mac
program.exe    # Windows
